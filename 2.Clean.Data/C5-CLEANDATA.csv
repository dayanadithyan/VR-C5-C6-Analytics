The new presidential task forces are a serious escalation in the president’s move to militarize the activities of the state in the name of national security and as a response to the pandemic. Both new task forces appear to be exclusively Sinhala and include suspected war criminals, indicating Sri Lanka’s strengthening of its ethnocracy with the backing of a president who stands accused of mass atrocities. “Rajapaksa’s new presidential task forces will exacerbate the existing militarization and state-sponsored colonization of the Tamil-dominated North-East, breeding further tension and instability in the region,” said PEARL. “His appointment of war criminals to lead the task forces reiterates his absolute disregard for international calls for accountability (Canada) for the mass atrocities committed against Tamils in 2009.” The “Presidential Task Force to build a Secure Country, Disciplined, Virtuous and Lawful Society” is made up entirely of military and police officials, including those credibly accused of committing war crimes according to the UN and the United States. The goals of the task force are written ambiguously - to “curb illegal activities of social groups” and “take legal action against persons responsible for...anti-social activities”. This gives the task force a wide remit, which solidifies fears that Sri Lanka could strengthen its restriction of human rights organizations, Tamil civil society groups, and political actors. The task force is also given license to “take measures” against those in other countries, which sanctions increased targeting and surveillance of Tamils in the diaspora(Norway, Canada).",NA,NA,Tamil,0,0,0

Although the May 2009 defeat of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has dramatically reduced the diaspora’s(from Norway and Canada) influence, the majority of Tamils outside Sri Lanka continue to support a separate state, and the diaspora’s money can ensure it plays a role in the country’s future. The nature of that role, however, depends largely on how the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) deals with its Tamil citizens in the coming months and on how strongly the international community presses the government to enact constitutional reforms to share power with and protect the rights of Tamils and other minorities. While the million-strong diaspora cannot regenerate an insurgency in Sri Lanka on its own, its money and organization could turn up the volume on any violence that might eventually re-emerge. India, Western governments and multilateral organizations can do much more to assist the political empowerment of Tamils in Sri Lanka and press GoSL to address the causes behind the rise of the LTTE and other Tamil militant groups. Donor governments and the UN should also press more strongly for an independent inquiry into the thousands of civilians, almost all Tamil, killed in the final months of fighting. Their aid should be tied to an end to impunity for human rights violations and abuses of political power that undermine democracy and threaten the freedoms of Sri Lankans from all ethnic communities.",NA,NA,Tamil,0,0,0

Manikkavasagam,"The common view is that politics have been militarized under the rule of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa due to his military background. He has appointed ex-military personnel to high positions in his government, including the post of Defence Secretary. The armed forces played a vital role in defeating the terrorists of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and their sacrifice and commitment must be applauded by all citizens of Sri Lanka. The civil war in the country began with several Tamil youth taking up arms. Following the 1983 race riots in Sri Lanka and the economic damage suffered by the Tamil community in the South of the country, these separatist movements gained momentum. The Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) that entered the fray as the result of the Sri Lankan government's agreement with India, did not resolve the ethnic crisis. This interim period saw the LTTE become the main Tamil group fighting for a separate state. The LTTE gained the assistance of several foreign countries in its war against the Sri Lankan government. The Norwegian government's attempt to intermediate in the civil war further weakened the Sri Lankan government according to some analysts. Following the renewal of hostilities, the Sri Lankan government was able to win a military victory over the LTTE and end the war. However, succesive governments have found it necessary to resort to majority chauvinism in order to win the Sinhala Buddhist vote and come into power. Following the election of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa the military has become so inter-twined with the government that it has become impossible to separate the two. Rajapaksa has ensured that the military is in the forefront of the country's battle against the coronavirus pandemic. The forthcoming general election will see an ex-army officer contest the Kilinochchi District in the Northern predominantly Tamil part of the country. This is being touted as a symbol of how far the nation has come since the end of the ethnic conflict in 2009 and the unity between the Sinhala and Tamil communities. However, it can also be seen as a sign of how militarized Sri Lankan politics has become.",NA,NA,Tamil,-1,0,-1

Pleas for cooperation and compromise have gone unheeded and there is an urgent need for reconciliation between people and government. Norwegian Professor Johan Galtung, Founder of Oslo Peace Research Institute, advocates conflict resolution by identifying the main parties in every conflict as being victim and perpetrator, and having four possible outcomes. Galtung states that in order to achieve a favourable solution for both parties, they need to be sufficiently convinced that peace is the only viable option. In Galtung terminology, HongKong's internal conflict is overshadowed by the more complex Chinese global conflict in view of China's tenuous relationship with the US; resulting in both parties identifying themselves as victims.

This article will try to reveal the hidden forces that attempted to draw out the war under the guise of peace.

The height of this farce was the Norway affilitated Cease Fire Agreement signed in 2002 between the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE. The CFA disgracefully gave the terrorists and the democratically elected government of Sri Lanka equal standing and legitimized the LTTE's demands for a separate state on the international stage.

A video depicting members of the LTTE receiving weapons training from the Norwegian armed forces at a camp named Rena was screened at the conference.

Following the defeat of the LTTE, the argument has been made that the international community should have intervened to stop the fighting earlier, invoking the concept of the Right to Protect (R2P), as the Sri Lankan Government is as responsible as the LTTE for civilain deaths. Others, such as former Norwegian official Vidar Hegelsen, have argued that the outcome of the Sri Lankan conflict reflects conflict-resolution in the post-American way, in which the use of brute force would replace emerging international norms and architecture for human security, the responsibility to protect, peace-building, peace-mediation, etc., making them obsolete before they even got started. This would lead to a  call for an international investigation into what happened and how to allocate blame for alleged war crimes between the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE. This does little favour to Sri Lanka. What happened in Sri Lanka was a straight-forward civil war, initiated by a separatist terrorist organization, which cost up to 70,000 lives. During the 25 yeasr the war lasted, the Sri Lankan Government appealed for help from the international community, through a variety of peace-mediation efforts, both from India and the Scandinavian countries.

Upon encouraging seismic surveys conducted by a Norwegian contractor in 2002 and 2005, Cairns India, which had a proven track record in the discovery of oil and gas in Rajasthan, India, the task of exploring the Mannar Basin was awarded to Cairns Sri Lanka in 2008. Though the company discovered gas in three wells in the Mannar Basin, there was insufficient oil discovered to make it a commercially viable project. Cairns Sri Lanka's license with the Sri Lankan government expired in 2016 and the then government awarded the contract to another company in 2017.

She pointed out that though most people assume that Norway's economic advancement was due to the discovery of oil and gas, an equally important factor was the equal participation of men and women in the labour force. Norway introduced quotas to achieve gender parity and this has resulted in competitive advantage and the Norwegian government continues to build the gender equality policy through positive stimuli.

Initially, the demand has come to articulate the Muslim majority areas in the North-Eastern region to be merged and be recognized as a self-governing autonomous unit for the Muslims, in non-contiguous basis on the assumption that the northern and eastern provinces would be constituted as one territorial unit. The SLMC, the first ever successful Muslim political party in Sri Lanka which committed itself to safeguarding the interests of the Muslim community in the Northern and Eastern provinces has been advocating the demand for nearly the last 30 years. The demand for Muslim autonomy in the Eastern province was at its peak during two distinct periods, first in 1984-89, and then in 1995-2000. Subsequently, changes have taken place in the autonomy demand due to the fragmentation of Muslim politics and to the complex situation in the Eastern province. However, after the de-merger of the Eastern province from the Northern provinces in October 2006, and the emergence of new political context in the Eastern province, thereafter due to the military defeat of the separatists’ terrorism, the demand has come to lose its relevance and vitality. Muslims demand for territorial autonomy has not been given adequate recognition in most of the initiatives taken to resolve the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka. Only the peace process under the PA government held from 1995 to 2000 paid a considerable attention to the demand by proposing a unit in the name of ‘South Eastern regional council’ in its draft constitution. Both the popular India mediated (1984-1989) and Norway facilitated (2002-2006) peace processes have side-tracked the inclusion of Muslims demand for autonomy.",NA,NA,Tamil,0,0,0

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who stood alongside Trump in the White House during the roll-out, immediately indicated his support for the plan, but the Palestinian leadership emphatically rejected the proposal. While the plan contains many aspects that appeal to the right of Israeli politics in particular the extension of Israeli sovereignty to Israel’s West Bank settlements, and the maintenance of Israeli security control everywhere to the west of the Jordan border it also lays the path for the establishment of a Palestinian state. Trump’s so-called peace plan unilaterally annuls previous UN resolutions on the Palestinian issue and has drawn criticism for giving Israel almost everything it demanded. Under the 1995 Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, was divided into three portions Area A, B and C. Israel prevents Palestinians from conducting construction projects in parts of the West Bank designated as Area C under the agreement, which falls under administrative and security control of Israel. Area C is currently home to 300,000 Palestinians, the vast majority of whom are Bedouins and herding communities who predominantly live in tents, caravans and caves.

He stated that in the West, the UK, and Norway, are recognised as secular democracies inspite of being avowedly ‘Christian’ nations. He said, it only means that a secular democratic government needs to respect the dominant religious culture of the people, but need not accommodate totalitarian dogmatic tenets, if any, like death for apostasy, that go against modern scientific knowledge and secular ethics. The same applies to predominantly Buddhist Sri Lanka with relevant adjustments. Considering the current besieged state of the Buddha Sasanaya, despite the age-old Buddhist civilizational foundation of the Sri Lankan state being its cultural lynchpin, the constitutional recognition of the need to protect it is in the interest of all Sri Lankans, he added.",NA,NA,English,0,0,0

Across the Global Social Mobility Index, only a handful of nations across the 82 countries covered have put in place the right conditions to foster social mobility. Further, the report warns that while social mobility requires a new set of public investments, it is the mix and quality of investments that will make them effective and they must be paired with shifts in business practices. Improving social mobility is a multi-stakeholder challenge, in which businesses must also take the lead by promoting a culture of meritocracy in hiring, providing vocational education, reskilling, upskilling, improving working conditions and paying fair wages. The most socially mobile societies in the world, according to the report’s Global Social Mobility Index, are all European. In the inaugural year of the report, the Nordic nations hold the top five spots, led by Denmark in first place followed by Norway, Finland and Sweden.",NA,NA,English,0,0,0

When he probed further, his friend said that the funding had come through the BBS and was from Norway, but what had initially been provided was no longer available. He also said by April 2013, there was much questioning of the support the Norwegians had provided to the BBS. Towards the end of the month, the Norwegian Embassy published an explanation, which convinced the writer, as he said in an article he wrote thereafter, that ""The Norwegian Government and its Embassy have not behaved badly, but also they, and the Sri Lankan Government, must go more carefully into the matter and check on what exactly has been going on. Further he said, the Norwegian statement had suggested that it was only the trip to Norway for which the Norwegians had provided funding, noting also that they had had no knowledge at all of the BBS when they funded several individuals to travel. But he said when he questioned the Ambassador closely about what was going on, he got the impression that the funds for Sithamu had also come from them.

Former British PM David Cameron took pride in claiming that the British were a Christian nation; he described what his government had done to support the Church. His predecessor Tony Blair was fanatical about his Christian faith. The Americans flaunt their faith even in their currency notes.

According to the writer’s opinion, he pointed out that the Norwegian Foreign Ministry staff in Sri Lanka generally behaved well, without underhand dealings inimical to this country. But he said, while he had and have a high regard for the Norwegian Foreign Ministry, he cannot say the same about the bigger players with regard to Sri Lanka, namely Erik Solheim, and also its Ambassador at the time the Peace Accord with the LTTE was signed, Jon Westerborg. Whether Solheim actually supported terrorism is a moot point, but he generally seemed to bend over backwards to make excuses for the LTTE. He also said, for 18 years, this questionable character held significant international positions, presiding in his view (and that of Ranil Wickremesinghe's Government initially) over the Sri Lankan peace process, then as a Minister, then as Chair of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, essentially a Western Bloc supposed to ""stimulate economic progress and world trade,"" and finally in the Under-Secretary-General post at the United Nations. He was supported right through this by the Norwegian establishment, including the Foreign Ministry. But he said, Westerborg was not as flamboyant as Solheim, he was also a very different kettle of fish from the professionals of the Norwegian Foreign Ministry. He came from an NGO background and had in fact served in Sri Lanka as Head of Redd Barna, the Norwegian Save the Children Fund.

As a result of global heating, the Earth no longer produces snow with the same regularity. So, ski resorts are being forced to manufacture it instead.

Elizabeth Burakowski at the University of New Hampshire said Ski resorts should be pushing renewable energy and many already rely heavily on it in some parts of the world. In Norway, for instance, almost 100 percent of the country's electricity comes from hydropower.

The writer said, Switzerland cannot be blamed for seeking to exploit Sri Lanka’s weakness, especially in the wake of wartime Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s election as the President just 10 days before. In overall Western strategy, Switzerland accommodated Inspector Nishantha Silva in its asylum programme, caused media furor over an alleged abduction in Colombo, and then questioned the LTTE’s terrorist tag in a high profile case heard there. He said, Karunanidhi informed the State Assembly of the LTTE’s direct involvement in a spate of incidents. The DMK leader had no option but to acknowledge the LTTE’s complicity in attacks on Tamil Nadu fishermen. Reporting a slight increase in such attacks, Minister Anthony accused the SLN of killing 77 Tamil Nadu fishermen between 1991 and 2007 period. What Tamil Nadu as well as India, never expected was the Maldives intervening in the clandestine LTTE arms smuggling operation. The Maldivians rescued five persons who jumped overboard from the sinking vessel, subsequently identified as ‘Sri Krishna’. The Maldivians had intercepted the ‘Sri Krishna’, the Norwegian embassy in Colombo sought information from the Maldivian High Commission in Colombo regarding the incident.

Maravanpulavu K Sachitananthan, leader of the Sri Lankan Shiva Senai, a group of Hindus in the island nation, said the situation for Hindus in Sri Lanka was not different from their situation in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. But the bill has “conveniently ignored the 10,000-year-old history of the Hindus in Sri Lanka,” Sachitananthan said.In India, the demand to include Tamil Hindus resonated in the Lok Sabha as well, with parties such as the BJP and the DMK raising demand. T Siva, Rajya Sabha MP and senior DMK member said the government should reconsider leaving out Muslims and Tamil Hindus from the CAB’s ambit. Speaking during the discussion Dayanidhi Maran of the DMK raised the issue as did BJD’s Prasanna Acharya who said, “We’ll support Citizenship Amendment Bill but our suggestion is to include Sri Lanka in it.”Making a case for extending the ambit of the Bill to Tamil Hindu, the Shiva Senai, which claims to have support from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) cited a long list of incidents of alleged attacks on Hindu properties, including temples to buttress their case. “…Today Hindus have fled to 40 countries seeking refuge. Twelve lakh Hindu refugees from Sri Lanka are spread across the world. Except in India in almost all the countries these Hindu refugees enjoy citizenship or permanent resident status,” Sachitananthan said. He also mentioned that since 1983 almost 300,000 Tamil Hindus have been in India as refugees, of these 100,000 are in refugee camps, he added.

At the outset of the article he stated that the people of Sri Lanka have voted to end a five year long nightmare. Gota’s victory was not unexpected, but the sheer magnitude of the victory certainly was. He said what we saw was the reaction of a down trodden, persecuted, humiliated majority community to all the suffering and indignities they had undergone for the past five years. He also said, the Tamils and Muslims voted for Sajith Premadasa because he was willing to do their bidding to be a Vibheeshana to the Sinhalese. Ranil Wickremesinghe was also willing to do the bidding of the minorities and he too wanted to contest. But the reason why the minority parties backed Sajith was because they thought that the latter would be better able to deceive the Sinhalese. This election result has put paid to that kind of politics. Moreover, he said, there is of course a question over whether the Tamil and Muslim reaction to Gota’s Presidential candidacy was due to his being the main architect of the war that crushed LTTE terrorism and the erroneous belief that he was behind the anti-Muslim Bodu Bala Sena. The BBS was actually used by certain local and international forces including the Jathika Hela Urumaya and Norway, to oust the Rajapaksa government.

Exactly 20 years have passed since the Oslo accords were signed on the White House lawn. For all their shortcomings and ambiguities, the accords constituted a historic breakthrough in the century-old conflict between Jews and Arabs in Palestine. It was the first peace agreement between the two principal parties to the conflict: Israelis and Palestinians. The accords represented real progress on three fronts: the Palestine Liberation Organisation recognised the state of Israel; Israel recognised the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people; and both sides agreed to resolve their outstanding differences by peaceful means. The Oslo Accords, which were signed in 1993, were designed as confidence-building measures to create trust between Israelis and Palestinians and bring peace to the region. Yet less than a decade after those accords were signed, the region was already mired in war and it failed to prevent Jewish settlements in Palestine.

The appointment was one of the two changes in the Norwegian peace facilitation process in Sri Lanka.

They conveniently forgot the fact that the LTTE maximised the use of its conventional and intelligence capabilities to achieve its political objectives. Gotabaya Rajapaksa realized the certainty of resumption of the war though the Norwegians were pushing for direct negotiations.

At the outset of the article, he noted about the demands made by disabled soldiers. They demanded Rs. 110,000 per month for life for themselves and for their wife after his demise. The writer said that, it was wrong to ask for that high pension and it was doubly wrong for the government to grant it.  And also he explained that, the government revenue, 95.6 percent of it, comes from the income that we earn and pay the government as taxes. When public servants hold government to ransom, they hold tax payers to ransom to pay salary earners in government a greater part of the latter’s income as taxes. It makes perfect sense to pay more of our income to government as taxes, to pay higher wages to government employees, when public servants provide better services to the public. In Sweden, in Denmark, in Norway and in Finland income earners, on average, pay 60 percent of their income to government, as taxes.

The Japanese envoy had been involved in the Oslo-led peace process that almost led to the division of the country, on ethnic lines. Sri Lanka Peace Co-Chairs comprised the US, EU, Norway and Japan. Japan played a significant role in the controversial Norwegian initiative. Akashi’s efforts, as well as those of his Norwegian counterpart Erik Solheim, failed to convince the LTTE not to abandon negotiations. The LTTE quit the negotiating process, in April 2003. It totally disregarded Norwegian and Japanese efforts to resume negotiations. Instead, they gradually stepped up pressure on the GoSL. Had the LTTE succeeded in assassinating Army Chief Sarath Fonseka (April, 2006) and Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa (Dec, 2006) in the wake of Kadirgamar’s killing, in Aug 2005, it could have had gained the upper hand. Before conferring Sri Lanka Ratna on Akashi, Sri Lanka should have examined the Japanese role in the Norwegian deliberate actions to cover up for the Tigers. The Norway-led Scandinavian truce monitoring mission played pandu with Sri Lanka’s national security. Japan never received the international recognition it sought by way of a significant role in the Norway-led process. In fact, the Norwegian, initiative, too, went awry, much to the disappointment of those who believed the LTTE could be influenced to toe the line. If the GoSL asserted Akashi deserved Sri Lanka Ratna for his role in the failed peace process, there is absolutely no harm in bestowing a similar honour on the then Norwegian peace envoy Erik Solheim.",NA,NA,English,-1,0,-1

2019-05-29T00:00:00Z,Daily FT,Long Opinion,Neutral,Neutral,Why a political settlement with the LTTE to peacefully end the war was not possible,Pitasanna Shanmugathas,"The article discusses the end of the Sri Lankan civil war that stretched for 25 years. The war killed thousands of civilians and practiced inhuman techniques, like the Liberation Tamils of Tiger Eelam (LTTE) using “Tamil civilians as human shields.” The author questions why a political settlement for the war could not occur compared to a violent solution. The reasoning behind this question differs between ultra-Tamil nationalists and Sinhalese nationalists- ultra-Tamil nationalists find blame in “the fault of successive Sri Lankan governments, whereas Sinhalese nationalists assert” blame on Prabhakaran, the leader of the LTTE.  The author argues “the true reason” is the “result of both Prabhakaran’s unwillingness to genuinely consider a political solution to the end of the war as party rivalry between the UNP and the SLFP.” The author then details cases where these parties mentioned could have created a peaceful resolution. The first ceasefire in 1995 came between President Chandrika Kumaratunga and the LTTE until Prabhakaran broke the ceasefire abruptly. The article goes into detail about Prabhakaran’s reluctance to cooperate with the government. In the second ceasefire Norway led peace talks between the LTTE and government. During this process “the LTTE viewed Ranil Wickremesinghe far more favourably than Chandrika Kumaratunga.” Ranil had a large presence during the peace process while Chandrika Kumaratunga “felt increasingly excluded” and party rivalry arose again despite the hope of the Norway-brokered peace process. The author ends his analysis by mentioning that Tamils in diaspora are claiming that the Sri Lankan Government carried out genocide without saying the atrocities the LTTE committed.",NA,NA,English,0,0,0

The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) were able to receive so much funding due to their successful exposure of the treatment of the Tamil minority in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka celebrates ten year since the end of the war while “still recovering from a series of bomb blasts, carried out by Muslim extremists on Easter Sunday.” The article draws comparison between Muslims and Tamils as the Sinhalese majority attacked these individuals from this group after mass events of violence were carried out by extremist factions of Muslims and Tamils. The Sinhalese retaliation garnered more support from the Tamil community for LTTE after being subjected to terror from Sinhalese people. Another parallel is how the Tigers would ask “educated Tamils why they had to find employment in establishments owned by the Sinhalese,” essentially disapproving of all Tamils who were involved with the majority in any way. Similarly, many Sinhalese people have been “boycotting doing business with Muslim owned shops.” The article highlights the fact that the LTTE’s work was well arranged as “it was able to rope in assistance or draw the sympathy from Norway with Eric Solheim being the point man for the country that playing the role od mediator.” The article concludes by mentioning the actions taken by Sri Lankans across the country who honoured the lives lost during the war in May.",NA,NA,English,-1,0,-1

The author states that the communal attacks the statement refers to are not related to the Easter Sunday attacks, but related to gangs. The author then criticises President Sirisena’s frequent move to ban social media in the country after violence occurs, claiming that this limits Sri Lankans abroad contact to their relatives and friends in the country. The author then analyses the use of the phrasing “’Sri Lanka, a majority Buddhist country.’” He argues that this phrase is an “unnecessary reminder” that incriminates Sinhalese Buddhists as if they committed the attack, when the bombers were from “the ISIS-sponsored National Thawheed Jamath (NTJ). The author highlights the religious harmony that occurs in the country as these religions work in harmony together and benefit from each other to create a distinct Sri Lankan culture.  The religious composition of Sri Lanka includes four major religions, Buddhism, Islam, Christianity, and Hinduism. The author goes as far as to write, “to be a Sri Lankan is to be a Buddhist, to be a Hindu, to be a Muslim, to be a Christian.” The author then asserts that the EU is focused on “their own national trade interests, not Sri Lankans’ human rights.” The author criticises Western nations’ denunciation of Sri Lankan nationalists “as extremists who ill-treat the minorities.” Ultimately, the author calls for the EU to stop interfering with Sri Lankan affairs and in doing so the problems of the country can be resolved.",NA,NA,English,-1,0,-1

What Erik Solheim tried to do in the guise of peace talks was to make Prabhakaran a hero. That was why a political wing of the LTTE was created amidst the Cease-fire Agreement. The Leader of it was Pulidevan.Pulidevan and others had tours in Europe with the help of Wickremesinghe.Pulidevan came to Colombo even to get hospitalised for an illness. What Wickremesinghe did even before the signing of the Cease-fire Agreement in 2002 was to remove barricades of the Army in Colombo and Suburbs. Wickremesinghe is doing the same thing at present. “That is how Gurudina analysis saw the danger of an arrival of a government of Wickremesinghe into power again. Erik Solheim who betrayed this country together with Wickremesinghe in the past is narrating at present a story like this.” When witnessing the horrific photos released from Sri Lanka it should be reminded that Christians and Muslims are communities who belong to the minority in that country. Historically Muslims have acted as a moderate and a peaceful group.

In neighbouring Norway, hundreds of hectares of forest were also destroyed by fires. Local authorities announced they had largely contained the most threatening fire, which covered some 700 hectares in Norway’s south-west around Sokndal. No injuries were reported.

2019-04-24T00:00:00Z,The Island,Long Opinion,Negative,Neutral,Cardinal Ranjith raps Govt. over ‘NZ revenge attack’,Shamindra Ferdinando,"In this opinion piece, the author decries a tweet from former Norwegian peace negotiator Erik Solheim. The tweet stated: ""When we watch the horrific pictures from Sri Lanka, it is important to remember that Muslims and Christians are small minorities. Muslims historically were moderate and peaceful. They have been victims of violence in Sri Lanka, not orchestrating it."" The author notes that ‘UN’s environment chief, Erik Solheim resigned early this year following severe criticism of his global travels and internal rule-breaking which led some nations to suspend their funding’. The author recounts the numerous negative and angry responses Solheim received on social media. 
In a reply to a response his tweet received, Solheim stated ""My friends in Sri Lanka among many others Chandrika, Ranil and Mahinda. Everything we did in the peace process was on their request."" The author of the piece rejects this stating that:
Solheim declaration that Norway handled the peace process the way Chandrika, Ranil and Mahinda wanted was nothing but a blatant lie meant to deceive the people here and the international community. Only Wickremesinghe really believed in the Norwegian project though Oslo also failed him badly.
Norway finalized a Ceasefire Agreement (CFA) under questionable circumstances in Feb 2002 between the then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran. They didn’t even bother to consult the then President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, let alone secure her blessings. Mahinda Rajapaksa, in spite of assuring his commitment to the Norwegian initiative, following the Nov 2005 presidential election, launched a sustained combined security forces campaign, in Aug 2006 once the LTTE resumed large scale hostilities.
Norway never listened to President Rajapaksa. Norwegians always believed Sri Lanka should agree to a negotiated settlement on Prabhakaran’s terms as the organization was militarily in an unbeatable position. Sri Lanka proved Norway wrong in less than three years after Prabhakaran resumed the war, with large scale simultaneous attacks in both the northern and eastern theatres.
The author goes on to state;
Solheim still seems keen to influence and deceive the Sri Lankan public. Those who responded to Solheim’s tweet, the writer believes represented the interests of the vast majority of people. Unfortunately, the government lacked an efficient apparatus to counter lies and anti-Sri Lanka propaganda. Interested parties exploit Sri Lanka’s failure to counter propaganda and lies, both here and abroad. Solheim has cleverly misinterpreted facts to divert attention from the murderous group responsible for the Easter Sunday carnage - the largest single coordinated suicide attack directed against non-military targets in Sri Lanka.
Why did Solheim play down unprecedented multiple attacks on prominent places of worship, like St. Anthony’s Church at Kochchikade, Kotahena, St. Jude Church at Katuwapitiya, Protestant Zion Church in Batticaloa, three leading hotels, namely Shangri-La, Cinnamon Grand and the Kingsbury in Colombo, and Tropical Inn, a rest house at Dehiwela.

The writer opines that one primary tragedy that history has shown in relation to Norwegian peace brokering during the Peace Process in 2002-2008, are that the allegations against Norway have been immensely ""biased"". As a result, disagreements between parties in the negotiation table have naturally caused ideological distance. The doubt related to Norwegian neutrality impeded the Sri Lankan government to step forward with the fullest international cooperation extended for humanitarian aid. The values could have maximized both with the peace-broker and with its strongly connected international community linkages. However, they were left unfulfilled. Added to that, there were a couple foreign authors in the Report called ""Pawns of Peace"" who have implied quite clearly the diminishing role of Norway in the peace process with the emergence of interest clashes between all parties involved. Furthermore, crucial occurrences in the military sector and prevailing political disagreements since 2007, have made limitations over benefiting from the entrusted international cooperation. The writer remarks that the lesson one extracts in this regard is the requirement of strong connectivity for mutual cooperation between international peace builders and among those that want open dialogue. Moreover, if persuasion of ""biasness"" is never corrected, there exists then the incredibility of the peace builder’s capability",NA,NA,English,-1,0,-1

Lord Naseby again highlighted the relevance of wartime UK military dispatches from Colombo which questioned the authenticity of UN Resolutions based on unsubstantiated allegations. Lord Naseby directly blamed the UN Resolutions on the Tamils Diaspora particularly those based in the UK, Canada and the USA et al. The Conservative veteran reminded the UK of its failure to take action whatsoever in respect of UK-based Adele Balasingham, the Australian born wife of British citizen Anton Stanislaus Balasingham, wartime ideologue of the LTTE. Further the writer opines that the UK facilitated LTTE operations throughout the war by turning a blind eye to its activities. British citizen Balasingham, of Sri Lankan origin, was allowed to function as the ideologue of the group, even after it was categorised as a prohibited organization in the UK. Balasingham received privilege status even after his organization assassinated Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar in Aug 2005. UK didn’t find fault with Balasingham for being a key member of the LTTE. Instead of taking punitive action against Balasingham, the UK allowed the terrorist access to the top Norwegian diplomatic delegation.

2019-02-07T00:00:00Z,Ceylon Today,Long Opinion,Positive,Neutral,Playing global peter against Chinese pal,N Sathiya Moorthy,"The writer opines that Just as there is the massive and unmistakable ‘China angle’ to the ‘post-war’ Sri Lankan economic engagements than any time in the past, there was the American involvement in the Cold War era. In between, there was the ubiquitous Norwegian angle, be it in peace-making or economy, or both. The writer further opines that the distant Norway is back in the news, this time having to study the Nation’s marine wealth. The last time Norwegians undertook any study of the kind, they were evaluating Sri Lanka’s off-shore oil wealth and exploration possibilities, given their superior skills in the matter. So intertwined did the Norwegian engagements of the time become, the war-time Rajapaksa leadership blamed the predecessor Wickremesinghe dispensation of signing off a massive contract with the Norwegians less than a week before the relatively more successful and purposeful conclusion of the ceasefire with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The Norwegian involvement now, once again with the Sri Lankan marine resources study could unsettle India as it did earlier, as there is more to such studies, in geo-strategic and geo-political perceptions. Norway is not China. Norwegian interests are purely commercial, though China too professes only the same cause and justification, but the neighbourhood discomfort, if it came to that, cannot be wished away. If during the war years, India, for instance, sort of side-stepped the Norwegian engagement in Sri Lanka’s oil exploration studies, Oslo did keep India always in the loop, on the ceasefire, and subsequent peace efforts, which, however, did not succeed. Yet, some Indian strategic thinkers did say at the time that Norway was buying peace for Sri Lanka viz LTTE, only with its short, medium, and long-term commercial interests, and the strategic interests of Oslo’s ‘American principle’ in mind. Cheap, but then that was a perception. Now, with the Nation caught in the midst of election fever that refused to go away even as the twin polls of 2015 concluded, it is for the Norwegians to conclude how wise it would be for them to get involved with Sri Lanka, though not of the war-time, peacemaking variety. A future government, if not favourably composed and even more favourably disposed, could end it all, long before the Norwegian work commences on the ground, or in the sea.Norway’s is only one non-Chinese external investment and engagement arrangement, where there may be no ‘consensus’ (?) of the Hambantota/China kind. Now that the incumbent Government is nearing the end of its five-year term, other Nations intending on investing big in Sri Lanka would naturally want to go slow, until after the Nation’s Presidential and Parliamentary Elections are behind them, too. The irony is that during this period, China alone would have all of Sri Lanka, and all of Sri Lankan polity and State players dancing to their tunes, and their tunes, alone",NA,NA,English,1,0,1

These proposals released on 3 August 1995 were described as the “GL-Neelan package” by sections of the media. Within a few days of the package details appearing in the newspapers, the LTTE summoned a news conference on August 11, 1995. It was held by the LTTE’s political adviser Anton Stanislaus Balasingham and LTTE’s Political Wing Head Suppiah Paramu Tamilselvan.

The war ended and one side had been severely affected and the affected Tamil people have been left with the unhealed wounds. Now they need protection from another disaster. The shield should be the political solution i.e. non-withdrawable rights should be given to the Tamils. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) had initiated the armed conflict as they had not accepted the 13th Amendment which had been brought by India, as the solution.

But for all intents and purposes, it is dead and buried. And perhaps the most important reason is that the goal of two states no longer corresponds to facts on the ground. To be sure, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) still supports the two-state solution. But for the second key Palestinian player, Hamas, the goal of statehood is secondary to ensuring the predominance of Islam throughout the region. On this point, Hamas’s position aligns perfectly with that of Israel’s current far-right, religious-nationalist government, which cannot make the concessions that a two-state solution demands without betraying the core of its own fundamentalist ideology.

The ICC is now investigating what they term “serious allegations of corruption” in Sri Lanka. For the first time in the organisation’s 109-year history, the ICC this week announced a 15-day amnesty for cricketers and officials, starting on January 16. They are urged to divulge any approaches they may have received from fixers on the promise that they will not be penalised. There is evidence, however, that some cricketers under investigation are caught in a honey-trap, an approach widely used by organised criminals around the world. Others, mostly young players coming into the national side, are asked to fix matches by those that wield authority to earn a place in the team. Last July, Sri Lanka opener Danushka Gunathilaka was questioned by Police after a Norwegian woman was allegedly raped in a hotel room while he was present.

But Spokesperson of the TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran stated that the new constitution would be brought by February 4 this year. Behind his statement, there is a question lies, that is will it be possible? In 1025, when the Wickremesinghe headed government came to power, they created a mechanism to formulate the new constitution and in 2016 the parliament was changed as the Constitutional Assembly. Then six sub committees were formed and among the committees, members of Rajapaksa supporters also included and some them headed the committees. Then a Steering Committee was formed to formulate the draft constitution and that was headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The sub committees handed over the draft the Steering Committee and the committee tabled the draft in parliament in September 2017. At that time Rajapaksa faction declared that left the committees. Then contradiction came up with regard to the terms ‘unitary state’ and  ‘united state’. Following the dispute, for the last 15 months there no progress in the formulation of the constitution. Now 95 United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA)MPs behind Mahinda Rajapaksa would collectively oppose the new constitution. It shows that two-thirds majority would not be possible.

Followers have their own identity, just as leaders have theirs. To better understand the strength of the bond between leaders and led, Geert Hofstede, a social psychologist at IBM, developed the now familiar construct of “power distance”, which he defined as “the extent to which the less powerful members of organisations accept and expect that power is distributed unequally”. In Sri Lanka – which measures 80 on the Hofstede Comparative Power Distance Index and is therefore categorised as a high power distance culture – “people accept a hierarchical order in which everybody has a place and that needs no further justification.” The article mentions that examples of top-down leadership exist in every country, but what makes power distance especially relevant to hierarchical cultures like Sri Lanka (as well as Malaysia (100), the Philippines (94), China and Bangladesh (80), Indonesia (78), India (77) and Singapore (74) is the extent to which it is culturally reinforced at all levels of society. Incidentally, lower power distance cultures such as the United States (40), United Kingdom and Germany (both 35), Norway and Sweden (both 31), Denmark (18), and Australia (36) and New Zealand (22) distribute power through decentralised organisations where followers habitually question authority and reject authoritarian leaders",NA,NA,English,0,0,0

Rae was the Chairman of the Forum of Federations. As Chairman, Rae helped oversee constitutional discussions between the Government of Sri Lanka and Tamil Tiger rebels. In his critically-acclaimed book, Exporting Democracy: The Risks and Rewards of Pursuing a Good Idea,’ Rae dedicates a whole chapter to the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka and his experiences overseeing negotiations between the senior individuals of the LTTE and the Sri Lankan Government. In an interview with Pitasanna Shanmugathas, to discuss his role during the Norway brokered ceasefire between the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE, Rae stressed the need for Sri Lankan to adopt a pluralist constitution that respects, protects, and provides rights to all communities. Responding to the question “Can you tell me how the Forum of Federations initially became involved in Sri Lanka?”, Rae stated that they were approached—initially before and after the ceasefire was negotiated—by the Government of Sri Lanka and by the Government of Norway to try to help in the process of discussions with the LTTE.  He added for a period of about three or four years, the Forum of Federations, and he, as Chairman,  as well as David Cameron (the  Dean of Arts and Science at the University of Toronto), had been working closely with the [Sri Lankan] Government, with the Government of Norway, and with the leadership of the LTTE. Responding to another query, he said during a meeting between Anton Balasingham and the Government in Oslo in 2003-2004, it looked as if they were agreeing that a range of possibilities within the federal arrangement should be looked at and should be a focus. Responding to the following question “A lot of people are quick to call what happened to the Tamils in Sri Lanka genocide. Even, your former Liberal colleague MP Jim Karygiannis, whom I interviewed, said that what happened to Tamils in Sri Lanka is ‘nothing less than genocide’”, he replied that It was a horrendous, violent attempt to overpower the Tamil minority and to entirely eliminate the political leadership of the community.

A the time when Sri Lanka got independence, the Tamil political leaders had struggled to get their rights in a democratic way. For four decades they had been demonstrated for their rights in a democratic way. The Bandaranaike–Chelvanayakam Pact and Dudley Senanayake - Chelvanayakam Pact were made but they were abandoned. As efforts of the Tamil political leaders failed, the Tamil youth initiated armed struggle against the government and it went on for three decades. The governments who came to power made agreements with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and then they were dropped. In 1987, the Indo-Lanka Accord was made and provincial governements were established and it was expected that the problems be resolved but nothing had happened. During Chandrika Kumaratunka’s presidency peace talks held but it got failed and armed struggle continued. In 2000, another plan was tabeled in parliament and it was rejected by the United National Party (UNP). In 2001, a government was formed headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and peace talks resumed with the mediation of Norway. From 2002 to 2004 the peace talks had been held and agreements were signed with the LTTE and they agreed to resolve the problems but it failed.

In his speech, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa stressed that the only way to restore stability to a destablised democracy, will be through a General Election. He said according to our Constitution, sovereignty is vested in the people and not in Parliament. He further questioned the argument, put forward by certain voices, that the president does not have the power to dissolve Parliament as per the 19th Amendment. He recalled a copy of a report published by an inter-governmental organisation called the ‘International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance’. According to that report, he stated that there are only two countries that require a two-thirds majority to dissolve Parliament – Kosovo and Lithuania. However, the head of states of the said countries can dissolve Parliament if a no confidence motion against the Government is adopted or if the statement of government policy is rejected. He furthered stated that the only country mentioned therein which has a Parliament that cannot be dissolved under any circumstances until the end of its term, is Norway. The premier noted that the situation in Norway is different to that of Sri Lanka’s. Since the population of Norway is smaller than the whole of Sri Lanka’s Western Province. Furthermore, Norway is a constitutional monarchy. Even if a government is defeated in Parliament, it has to continue in office until a new government is appointed by the King. When the King in Council presents the annual budget to Parliament, it will be debated but there is no tradition of defeating budgets in Norway. Most of the time, Norway has had minority governments that do not have a majority in Parliament. That is the situation at this moment as well.

As Chairman, the article mentions that Rae helped oversee constitutional discussions between the Government of Sri Lanka and Tamil Tiger rebels. In his critically-acclaimed book, Exporting Democracy: The Risks and Rewards of Pursuing a Good Idea,’ Rae dedicates a whole chapter to the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka and his experiences overseeing negotiations between the senior individuals of the LTTE and the Sri Lankan Government. In 2015, the interviewer had a chance to sit down with Rae for an interview to discuss his role during the Norway brokered ceasefire between the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE. Rae stressed the need for Sri Lankan to adopt a pluralist constitution that respects, protects, and provides rights to all communities.  Responding to a question on how the Forum of Federations initially became involved in Sri Lanka, Rae stated that the forum was approached by the Government of Sri Lanka and by the Government of Norway to try to help in the process of discussions with the LTTE. Therefore, for a period of about three or four years, the Forum of Federations, Rae, as Chairman,  as well as David Cameron (the  Dean of Arts and Science at the University of Toronto), were working closely with the Sri Lankan Government, with the Government of Norway, and with the leadership of the LTTE. With regard to the failed negotiation with the senior leadership of the LTTE, Rae commented that the fundamental reason that a negotiation usually fails is because either one party or both parties to the negotiation conclude that it is better to continue with the struggle and the conflict than to try to reach a solution. Rae also commented on the Forum pushing towards a federalist solution. He stated that during the meeting between Anton Balasingham and the Government in Oslo in 2003-2004, where it looked as if they were agreeing that a range of possibilities within the federal arrangement should be looked at and should be a focus.",NA,NA,English,-1,0,-1

This is important as many of the independent and sovereign countries that constitute the international community are indeed small states in terms or geographical size or population. Small states have indeed at various times played a significant role and often this has been within the framework of international groupings. One can think back of the past role of Ceylon/Sri Lanka as a member of the Non-Aligned Movement. However in more recent years small states have earned recognition as economic success stories and even in some cases models to be emulated by others. The countries that come to mind are Singapore, Dubai, Ireland, Luxembourg and Iceland. The countries that have scored high on this measure are by and large European countries with small populations and quite often small territories. They include Norway (first in the list), Iceland, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands and Ireland among the highest ranking. It can therefore be argued that well managed Small States can indeed become success stories and combine economic growth with sustainability and inclusiveness.",NA,NA,English,0,0,0

The writer opines that the human race is at fault and has created conditions leading to an explosion of jellyfish blooms around the world. The waste from farms and human settlements are thrown into waters that lead to the ocean. This leads to ‘eutrophication’. Eutrophication cause plants, such as algae and phytoplankton, to flourish, which in turn blocks sunlight from reaching to aquatic plants and marine creatures, killing them. The water is acidified. This environment suits jellyfish who thrive. Moreover, aquaculture is increasing the jellyfish numbers. The captive fish are free food; from giant shrimps, killed in India’s captive breeding stations, to salmon and trout in Scotland, Ireland and Norway. When additional feed is provided, eutrophication of the waters takes place. The aquaculture structures, like rafts, provide shade for polyps to grow.",NA,NA,English,0,0,0

Justice Minister Thalatha Atukorale profusely appreciated Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for accommodating her in the 10-member Constitutional Council (CC). However following the events that unfolded on the October 26, as far as President Sirisena is concerned, Ranil Wickremesinghe is no longer the Prime Minister and therefore he didn’t belong to the CC. Therefore the Constitutional Council/Parliament will have to decide whether Thalatha Atukorale can continue as the prime minister’s nominee as Wickremesinghe no longer holds that position. The article notes that during the last CC meeting, before President Sirisena divorced the United National Party (UNP), the CC announced the endorsement of two of the four names recommended to the Supreme Court by the Office of the President. The CC also approved one of the four names recommended by the Office of the President as judges of the Court of Appeal. The writer remarks that in case the Sirisena-Rajapaksa duo prove majority, in parliament, next month and the UNP would be forced to recognise Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister and the CC will find a different environment to work in. In the event they succeed, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) will lead the Opposition Leader’s post. In that case, the Constitutional Council/Parliament may have to decide on the Opposition Leader’s nominee, currently Chamal Rajapaksa. Further among the Second CC are two persons – former United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs Jayantha Dhanapala (1998-2003) and Attorney-at-law and former Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Javid Yusuf who was involved in the Norway-led peace process that led to all-out war in August 2006. Norway finalized the Ceasefire Agreement between Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) on Feb 21, 2002 close on the heels of the LTTE attempt to assassinate President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga who was having talks with the group. Yusuf functioned as the Director General of the Muslim Peace Secretariat at that time. The Muslim Peace Secretariat struggled to secure the LTTE’s consent to participate in the Norway-mediated talks overseas and to tackle problems faced by the community, especially those driven out of the Northern Province during Ranasinghe Premadasa’s presidency.

The article further notes that crucial significance of evicting the security forces from the North-East to the secessionist agenda was vividly portrayed in the priority placed on ""demilitarisation"" of the ‘North-East’ during the five rounds of Government-LTTE peace negotiations that took place from 16 November 2002 to 21 March 2003. The article mentions of a proposal endorsed by the Norway-led ‘Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission’, which recommended that certain High Security Zones (HSZ) could be evacuated fully or partially and made available for civilian use if the LTTE agrees to remove under independent verification its heavy artillery from the vicinity of the HSZs. This proposal was, however, firmly rejected by the LTTE.

The IPCC maps out four pathways to achieve 1.5C, with different combinations of land use and technological change. Reforestation is essential to all of them as are shifts to electric transport systems and greater adoption of carbon capture technology. Reversing these trends is essential if the world has any chance of reaching 1.5C without relying on the untried technology of solar radiation modification and other forms of geoengineering, which could have negative consequences. The report will be presented to governments at the UN climate conference in Poland at the end of this year. But analysts say there is much work to be done, with even pro-Paris deal nations involved in fossil fuel extraction that runs against the spirit of their commitments.

The small fisheries harbour located a short distance from the main town is an interesting venue, the base of fishing trawlers. For decades it has been a haven for local seafarers. You will witness crews getting ready to launch. Crews have confined resting areas, and most of them can cook. Perhaps the main place of value on the trawler is the storage section below the deck which can hold almost 10,000 Kg of fish. As some trawlers head to sea there are the others that have returned. Where you will see the crew unloading the prized catch. The ‘good quality’ fish are handed over to a man on the pier who sorted them according to size and placed the fish in green plastic crates. A truck then moves into position and the green crates are quickly loaded. More ice is added on top of the crates. A calico cat sits nearby and is fed with a small fish. Once the fish are unloaded the crew began to wash the cargo hold, scrubbing vigorously. Subsequently, the entire deck area is washed. The calico cat wandered off in search of another trawler. The work of these boat crews must be dignified and appreciated by society. After all, they face great risks to bring in our tantalizing seafood. In countries like Norway and USA deep sea boat crews earn well and enjoy a much better lifestyle. For these hard working people there is no retirement. They would probably sail into the sunset or find lasting rest in Davy Jones locker. We walked towards the car park. Suddenly the skies unleash torrents of rain. The salty wind added to the inclement weather. To the seasoned seafarers it is part of their work routine. They stood in the deluge, chatting.

The Supreme Court perhaps had no option because this monk is a serial offender having made a public spectacle of himself more times than one can keep account of. Earlier, he had been sentenced to six-months Rigorous Imprisonment by the Homagama Magistrate for threatening and intimidating Sandhya Eknaligoda, the wife of the missing political activist Prageeth Eknaligoda.

This international Day was launched in 2003 by the World Coalition against the Death Penalty, a coalition of non-governmental organisations, bar associations, local bodies and unions to strengthen the campaign against capital punishment. The EU joined the campaign in 2007 when it declared 10 October a European Day against capital punishment as well. Sri Lanka has been a de facto abolitionist state for 42 years, and in 2016 voted in favour of the United Nations General Assembly moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty. The EU applauds this record, and continues to encourage Sri Lanka to maintain this moratorium with a view towards complete abolition. Reports that the Government could resume executions caused serious concern.  The EU together with EU Member State missions and the diplomatic missions of Canada and Norway wrote to President Maithripala Sirisena to express their unequivocal opposition to capital punishment in all circumstances and in all cases.",NA,NA,English,0,0,0

2018-08-03T00:00:00Z,Daily Mirror,Short Opinion,Neutral,Neutral,Facts and myths about fat and starch,Susara Sanjeewa,"This article embarks in an academic discussion on the importance of consuming fat to enjoy a healthy life and clarifies any misunderstandings surrounding fat and carbohydrates. The article cites the most important first comprehensive study done in1950s by biochemist Ancel Keys on fat. The writer remarks that the study was highly manipulated to prove the theory that saturated fat increasing cholesterol in the blood and high cholesterol in turn raising the risk of heart diseases is not a well proven hypothesis. When the investigator analysed the total fat consumption and heart diseases in 22 countries, he noticed that there were countries such as Holland and Norway which had a higher consumption of fat with decreased incidences of heart attacks. A country like Chile has a decreased fat consumption, but has seen an increase in heart attacks. The writer notes that the investigator purposefully and unethically removed these countries in his studies to prove his theory. The recent study done in 18 countries taking into account more than 100,000 people in all five continents, concluded that higher the consumption of carbohydrates higher the deaths due to various diseases. It was also observed that the higher the fat (including saturated fat) consumption lesser the deaths.",NA,NA,English,0,0,0
2018-08-01T00:00:00Z,Daily Mirror,Long Opinion,Neutral,Neutral,Constitutional change and Gotabhaya’s solution,Dayan Jayatilleka,This article examines the viability of former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa’s primary solution for Sri Lanka’s political resolution of the underlying Tamil issue. The writer notes that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had been shown on TV and quoted on a supportive website addressing the Tamil media that his primary solution for the Tamil people will be to give them economic freedom. The writer argues that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa’s vision for a political solution was mere economic empowerment and lacks any political component. The writer further remarks that Gotabhaya’s formula for buying out Tamil political identity and the Northern Province erases the content and trajectory of Tamil political consciousness from 1949 and Indian diplomatic engagement in Sri Lanka. The writer opines that his solution is equivalent of Netanyahu’s attempt to bury the Oslo Accords and the two-state solution.,NA,NA,English,0,0,0
2018-08-01T00:00:00Z,Daily Mirror,Long Opinion,Negative,Neutral,Understanding Velupillai Pirapaharan’s mindset,Michael Roberts,"This article provides an detailed examination of the character of the de facto state of Thamil Ealam set up by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in 1990 after its successful guerrilla battles with the IPKF from 1987-89 and its seizure of swathes of territory in the Eastern Province in 1990. This examination is conducted upon recent revelations on the detailed course of Eelam War IV in its last phase in 2009 made possible by Lord Michael Naseby’s extraction of the contemporary readings of the battle theatre provided by the British Military Attache in Colombo, Lt. Col. Gash, which permits one to chart specific strands of deceit and conspiratorial design perpetuated by the Western states led by USA and Norway with the implicit or explicit participation of a host of humanitarian agencies, such as International Crisis Group, Amnesty International  and Human Rights Watch together with other foreign funded agencies in Colombo. The article mentions of the ceasefire brought Norway into the Sri Lankan scenario in a major way with Eric Solheim as its key diplomat and Anton Balasingham as the LTTE ‘magician.’ Which led the LTTE move on to the world stage as a de facto state, thereafter which LTTE delegations visited western capitals and Norwegian ministers paid state visits to Thamil Ealam. The article further highlights the assassination of Lakshman Kadirgamar, the major obstacle that stood in the way of the LTTE on the international stage and who was described as a ‘thorn in the Norwegian flesh’.",NA,NA,English,-1,0,-1

Prasanna,"Singapore is the best country in the world for children to grow up in, according to the second, and latest, annual End of Childhood report published by non-governmental organisation Save The Children. It tied with reigning champion Slovenia as the first out of 175 countries, performing well across the eight indicators: under-five mortality rate, child stunting, out-of-school children and youth, child labour, child marriage, adolescent birth rate, population displaced by conflict, and child homicide rate. Scandinavian countries Norway, Sweden and Finland rounded out the top five.  Asian countries occupied three of the top 20 spots, with South Korea ranking eighth and Japan 19th. However, they also comprised four of the bottom 10 spots in terms of child stunting. Child labour and child marriage also remain prolific problems in the Asian region, which is home to 40 per cent of all child labourers and has the highest rate of child marriage in the world. Sri Lanka showed promise across the board, avoiding any ‘moderate’, ‘high’ or ‘very high’ scores. However, still more than 17 percent of Sri Lankan children below age 5 suffer from stunting, according to the report, while almost one percent of babies die before their fifth birthday. Sri Lanka improved one place to 60 in the report’s ‘End of Childhood’ index, which ranks countries according to where childhood is most and least threatened. It outperformed most regional neighbours, with India ranking 113th, Bangladesh at 130th, Pakistan 149th and Myanmar 107th. Afghanistan - affected by ""harrowing violence, poverty and disadvantage"" - fell 10 points from 152nd place to 160th, while the Philippines fell from 96th place to 104th due to increased stunting levels and poor nutrition standards.",NA,NA,Tamil,0,0,0

Along with the Norwegian researchers, Sri Lankan scientists will be on board the research vessel during the course of the survey to map the available fish stocks and other resources within this region. Norgwegian Ambassador Thorbjorn Gaustadsaether in a recent interview with the Sunday Observer explained the importance of the survey to Sri Lanka and for the sustainable utilization of marine resources, while reminiscing into his country’s role as a onetime peace-maker. He stated that the purpose of the survey was to map the marine resources in Sri Lanka, adding it was important for Sri Lanka to have the information about its resources, fish as well as other marine resources, to form a basis for knowledge based sustainable management of the country’s marine environment and resources. Gaustadsaether added that the data collected would help the government to develop guidelines for sustainable fish resource management of Sri Lanka, and in turn would have a greater impact on the economy.",NA,NA,Tamil,1,1,2

2018-05-07T00:00:00Z,Tamil Mirror,Feature,Positive,Positive,Norway-Lanka university cooperation promoting clean energy solutions,"Thorbjørn Gaustadsæther, Dhayalan Velauthapillai","Fourteen Norwegian companies are coming to Sri Lanka this week to discuss the opportunities of clean energy with Sri Lankan counterparts. The gathering is a part of the collaboration between the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences and the University of Jaffna on clean energy. Businesses and industry need interdisciplinary research approaches to societal challenges, such as energy, climate change, food and water supply – which are key to new markets for products and services. Universities are the main source for new knowledge, innovative thinking and skill development on such societal needs. Increasingly too the partner universities’ research networks, with their international links, are privileged pools for the “people-sourcing” that industry and businesses conduct on a local and global basis. Businesses recognise the high value of this expertise. The collaboration between Norwegian and Sri Lankan universities has yielded positive results. Benefits extend beyond the partnerships themselves. University-industry collaborations can deliver innovative commercial products. The university benefits, not only because supporting clients of the laboratories provides valuable experience for students in working in real business situations, but also because businesses can see immediate and tangible advantages working with the laboratories. Some of the contacts made this way can turn into long-term research collaborations. A competent work force is the prime factor for successful implementation of new technologies. Attracting young students, the future work force, to scientific research is important for technological, economic and social development. The collaboration has successfully reached more than 2,700 school students in the Jaffna district through a clean energy awareness campaign and has provided a platform for innovative ideas. Making science and research attractive to young people will define the future of research and related technologies. Development of formal, effective and sustainable institutional cooperation across borders will significantly increase the quality of research, and allow expatriates to contribute to the overall development of their countries of origin in a sustainable and large-scale manner. It is encouraging to see Norwegians of Sri Lankan origin taking a lead in strengthening the relationship between Sri Lanka and Norway, as well as between institutions. The ongoing collaboration is an example of commitment and constructive approach towards building a sustainable future. It involves not only the two universities mentioned above, but also the University of Peredenyia and Universities of Bergen and Agder in Norway. Research on clean energy is the key to address the global challenge, which Sri Lanka too, is facing. Developing clean energy sources contributes to alleviating poverty, fuelling industrial production and transportation, expanding rural development and protecting health while promoting sustainability and environmental quality. Technological innovation and capacity in renewables result from a broad range of factors, and not merely from effective research and development efforts. These include the technological capability of a country, innovation-friendly regulation and market conditions that favour adaptive learning. This research collaboration is one of its kind in trying to bring academia and private sector together to achieve longstanding research and entrepreneurial partnerships on clean energy technologies in Sri Lanka. Overall, the ongoing cooperation between the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences and the University of Jaffna is a practical example of how the private sector and research institutions can complement each other, and the positive aspects of the contribution from Sri Lankan expatriates in the field of technical cooperation.",NA,NA,Tamil,1,1,2

I am referring to the cases where army people were used for killing persons like journalists Eknelligoda, Lasantha Wickramatunga and others. What happened in the war was a different issue completely. That is an international conspiracy against Sri Lanka. We know that. The Diaspora together with some foreign countries are directing a campaign against Sri Lanka. We know it for a fact.

It was during this period that Moe became acquainted with a youth named Tor Glad. Although they did various jobs under the Germans, they were dissatisfied. It was under these circumstances that they were persuaded to spy for Germany. Later, this duo began to work for the United Kingdom as spies. Significantly, they continued to work as double agents after being turned by the British, and thus fake sabotage operations were set up to keep the Germans from becoming suspicious.

That assertion and possibly other similar funding programs need investigation, proof and reflection whether and why Norway is intermeddling in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka. Norway widely believed to often act on behalf of powerful Western countries did invest heavily in Sri Lanka until 2004. By 22 February 2002 Norway succeeded in advancing the terrorist LTTE group to a status on par with a helpless Sri Lankan Government! However, it may not be the governments of these powerful countries who fund extremist activities in third world countries. It could well be the leaders of the more powerful arms industries who invest through lobby groups and foundations and discreetly finance powerful Western politicians as well as third world extremist groups. An ex-public servant working full time for one of these groups had in fact admitted the Norwegian involvement in his group. Vasudeva Nanayakkara’s assertion in Parliament needs to be investigated. He must make an official complaint to the IG Police calling for a comprehensive investigation. It is highly probable that powerful countries which failed to divide Sri Lanka into two have given way to these lobby groups to divide the Sri Lankan people on confrontational ethnic lines.

2018-03-11T00:00:00Z,The Island,Long Opinion,Neutral,Neutral,The united beneficiary of Sinhala-Muslim riots,C.A.Chandraprema,"This article states that after the riots that were sparked off about a week ago due to the death of a Sinhala truck driver following an assault by a group of Muslim men in Digana, the Yahapalana government has emerged steadier than it was earlier. It goes on to discuss the implications of operationalising the Office on Missing Persons (OMP) and the Enforced Disappearances Bill. Norway is mentioned in reference to Article 32 of the international Convention (which the Sri Lankan government has accepted by a separate declaration). This enables any member state to complain to the 10-member ‘Committee on Enforced Disappearances’ in Geneva that Sri Lanka is not fulfilling her obligations under this Convention and the Committee can investigate such complaints. Countries like the United States, Britain, Australia and Canada, never even signed this Convention. Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Ireland and India signed it ten years ago in 2007, but never ratified it. Many countries have kept away from this Convention altogether for the obvious reason that its provisions have the potential to violate the individual rights of citizens of the states that join it. The proposed law is an attempt to subject our armed forces to international war crimes prosecutions without using the term ‘war crimes’ and rephrasing it as ‘disappearances’. The only ‘disappeared’ persons whose cases will be dealt with under this proposed law, will be those of the LTTE because the armed forces have already categorised the thousands of soldiers who disappeared as ‘assumed to be dead’. However, LTTE combatants who have either died in battle or fled overseas still continue to be categorised as having ‘disappeared’ by all interested parties. The sentiment is negative towards Norway and the other countries mentioned because they have signed the Convention but have never ratified it whereas Sri Lanka is being asked to make Article 32 part of the law.",NA,NA,English,0,0,0

The bad news is that a fully-fledged trade war would create serious economic damage.

Nine WTO members (Brazil, China, Chinese Taipei, the EU, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway and Switzerland) opposed the safeguard measures in the WTO. It was found that the safeguards violated WTO rules by failing to show a 'causal link' between increased imports and 'serious injury' on the US side. Also, the US Government did not provide comprehensive and appropriate evidence of 'unforeseen developments' of steel imports explaining their increase.

The Sinhalese, who constitute over 70 percent of the population and Muslims, Burgers, etc. were to occupy the rest of the island. The Indo-Lanka Accord signed between President J.R. Jayewardene and Premier Rajiv Gandhi in 1987 was a memorandum of understanding for the ceasefire. A monitoring mission led by Norway was established and various peace talks were held in Thailand, Norway, Rose Garden – Thailand, Berlin – Germany and Hakone – Japan between September 2002 and February 2003. All these negotiations and the interventions of third parties finally resulted in the proposal by the LTTE to establish the Interim Self-Governing Authority (ISGA) under the Vaddukoddai Resolution of 1976 “to establish an independent and sovereign secular state for the Tamil people”.

The request made by the minister is commendable. This is not only the proposal of the minister but of the government of Sri Lanka. After the regime change in 2015, President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe have made the same request. Many of the Tamil diaspora in the western countries such as Canada, Switzerland, Norway, Britain, United States, France and Germany are very rich. The strength of the Tamil diaspora is that can determine political powers in countries like Canada and some other countries. They are very rich and powerful because of their hard working. Though they are citizens of other countries, they are very well connected to their homeland. On the other hand the Tamil diaspora have been marginalized as separatists and connected to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam for a long time. This situation came into existence as politicians have used the diaspora for their political purpose. Certain people of the diaspora could be in the mentality of nationalism as they had experienced by the measures taken by the Sinhala nationalists in the past, but it is unacceptable to categories that all Tamil diaspora are nationalists.

It was three times this extent a few decades back. The Forest Department was one of the first to be established by the British and is a hundred years old. The dwindling forest cover is a constant lament among environmentalists, ecologists, foresters and wildlife enthusiasts. Forests and trees have recognised economic and aesthetic value. Bhutan is a good example, maintaining some 70-80 per cent of the land area in natural forest, with a corresponding benefit to the ‘quality of life’. Generally trees are desirable and have many virtues that are the subject of this note. It is only exceptionally, such as when their roots invade building foundations or when they fall on roofs, that they cause damaging negative effects. The world is moving away from fossil fuels and moving to renewable energy forms – mainly solar, wind and biomass. In our context the last is most relevant, as the cheapest option and as rural dependence on wood fuel is very large. A good proportion of this is gathered from forests. An organised effort to grow high wood producing trees (Gliricidia initially) intends to make an impact on its use for industrial needs and for dendro-power generation. Strangely, little systematic attempts have been made to support and encourage domestic solar power installations. Even heavily industrialised, Western countries are busily expanding this option. For us, this would remove a considerable drain from grid supplies, releasing the saved power for other uses. The same holds for wind power. There has been some mention of Norwegian-assisted wave-energy projects. Meanwhile, for an inscrutable reason, two large coal power stations are reportedly imminent, at a time when the rest of the world is moving away from coal or power.",NA,NA,English,0,0,0

Many initiatives taken by the post-war Sri Lankan governments have not yielded any national reconciliation. In fact the divergent interests among various social, economic and political groups and increased social fragmentation have terrified the social cohesion and the future of Sri Lanka. According to the Centre for Policy Alternatives (2013), post-war Sri Lanka has recorded more than 65 communal clashes in January 2013, illustrating the very nature of disturbed co-existence among ethnic groups. In fact, these incidents remained untreated and have renewed new divisions within society that have made the topic of national reconciliation central to political and academic debates. The strained relationship between the Sinhalese and Tamils worsened when the sporadic riots against Tamils took place for decades and the worst riots took place in July 1983. In such situations, the state repression against these riots created further animosity forcing the Tamil youth to defend themselves against the attacks from the Sinhalese community. Eelam War I is the initial phase of the armed conflict (1970s to July 23, 1983) between the government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE. During this period, all communities experienced high levels of ethnic violence which resulted in the loss of many lives and major destruction of the infrastructure. This further increased the mistrust and feelings of hatred among communities. The massacre of 147 Muslims at prayer in the Kattankudy Mosque in the Eastern Province triggered hatred between the Tamils and Muslims. This was further worsened in 1990 when the LTTE expelled nearly 75,000 Muslims from the districts of Northern Province, such as Mannar, Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Vavuniya and Mullaitivu within a 48-hour period. The situation remained unchanged until the peace talks in 2002 (facilitated by Norway) to stop the military attacks between the LTTE and the government forces in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. At one point, to reach a political solution through peaceful negotiations, Ranil Wickremasinghe as the prime minister signed the Cease Fire Agreement (CFA) with the LTTE on February 22, 2002. To end the 20 years of conflict, Ranil Wickremasinghe insisted on a permanent solution based on a united Sri Lanka.

In spite of talks, the LTTE assassinated TULF lawmaker, Neelan Tiruchelvam, in July 1999, and almost succeed in eliminating Kumaratunga, at the final presidential polls campaign rally in Colombo, in December 1999. An angry Kumaratunga revealed how the LTTE made an attempt to eliminate her amidst Norwegian facilitated talks. Interestingly, at the time of Kadirgamar’s assassination, Norway oversaw Sri Lanka’s peace process. Even after Kadirgamar’s assassination, Western powers refused to acknowledge that there could not be a peaceful end to the conflict as long as the LTTE retained conventional military capability.

2018-01-20T00:00:00Z,Ceylon Today,Column,Neutral,Neutral,The pursuit of peace starting at SCOPP,Rajiva Wijesinha,"Towards the end of May 2007, Rajiva Wijesinha was asked to take on the position of Secretary-General of the Sri Lankan Secretariat for Coordinating the Peace Process (SCOPP). Mahinda Rajapaksa had suggested a couple of positions previously but those were after Wijesinha mentioned to him the need for swift actions in those areas. He did not accept, partly because he had not wanted him to think that he was angling for a position, partly because he was still on sabbatical and wanted to finish various books and journeys he had planned already. On June 1 Wijesinha received the formal letter of appointment but only took up the position on the June 7, when Palitha Kohona, his predecessor, was able to come for a formal handover. Kohona had given up his position with the UN to head SCOPP, but then had also concurrently been appointed Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which was obviously a more important job. The LTTE returned to talks after Mahinda Rajapaksa became the president, but it was clear they saw this as simply a holding operation while they built up their strength, and indeed they stepped up attacks from the time Rajapaksa was elected. In fact they only participated properly in negotiations once, that is in February 2006, and then boycotted the next round which had been fixed for April. In June they came to Geneva but refused to engage, perhaps because the Norwegian ambassador had made it clear, that the Sri Lankan side wanted to include the issue of child soldiers. This shows how egregiously the LTTE was continuing with the practice, which could not be ruled out. Wijesinha also found that he had to engage in multiple meetings with the international community who had invested heavily in the peace process. Amongst them the most important were the Norwegians, who had brokered the ceasefire. He had to work with the embassy, the Special Envoy Bauer, and also the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission, led then by General Lars Solvberg.",NA,NA,English,0,0,0

Among children of women who were not taking stimulants for ADHD, 35 out of every 1,000 babies had birth defects, compared with 46 out of every 1,000 infants born to women using drugs like Ritalin.

Brexit remains a key challenge to the British economy as many business investments are still waiting for clarification of direction, especially on what it will be like in a post-Brexit scenario. There are three possible scenarios. The first is the Norway option, which entails almost full participation in the single market by allowing free movement of goods, capital, services and people. This seems unlikely as it defeats the purpose of Brexit. The second, the Canada model, appears to be what the UK Government wants. In fact, UK Brexit negotiator, David Davis, has advocated for a ‘Canada plus plus plus’, suggesting a similar and better deal than the EU-Canada trade deal, known as the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA).

What marks these countries out is that many of them are very poor, and some of them are plagued by war, crime and/or massive corruption. But most of the immigrants to the United States have always come from countries like these; people who are safe and prosperous generally do not abandon the countries they grew up in. The first wave of Irish who went to the United States in the mid-19th century was driven by famine at home. The German, Polish, and Italian immigrants of the same period were fleeing both poverty and political repression; the Russian Jews were also fleeing anti-Semitic violence. They would all have been ‘shithole countries’ at the time. Trump wanted to know why the United States could not bring in immigrants from non-shithole places like Norway instead. From the point of view of Mexicans or Cubans, for example, El Salvador and Haiti are indeed shitholes. A Norwegian-American, Dr. Christian Christensen, said about the United States: “Of course people from Norway would love to move to a country where people are far more likely to get shot, live in poverty, get no healthcare, because they are poor, get no paid parental leave or subsidised day care and see fewer women in political power”.

Sathiya Moorthy,"This article states that President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe are using the parliament to meet their own political ends concerning the Bond Commission report on the Treasury Bond scandal. It was only natural for any opposition in the place of the Joint Opposition and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna to have demanded a special parliamentary session to discuss the report. It sounds strange in one way but is also a mockery of the system in another when Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe said that the opposition wanted a special session to discuss the probe panel report that he had given them – but he could not be expected to present the report to the House, as he did not have it. It was obvious that Wickremasinghe was telling the opposition to ask President Maithripala Sirisena if they wanted a copy of the report each, and not bother him anymore. Sri Lanka has had enough experience with ‘cohabitation governments’. As coincidence would have it, Ranil Wickremasinghe was the prime minister on both occasions. Under Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, who had the largest ever popular mandate in the country (which even Rajapaksa could not overcome after the war victory), Wickremasinghe was riding rough shod on the executive president, especially in matters of war and Norwegian peace-building with the dreaded LTTE.

In that sense, this election is very important. Hettiarachchi went on to say: “As poll observers we hope national politics will not interfere with this local election. People should have the opportunity to elect their local representative without any external interference. Unfortunately, under the new electoral system there are no preferential votes. The previous Sri Lankan system was a very democratic system where you could select the party as well as the candidate you preferred, but you do not have that choice now. Some countries in the West have this mixed system. It works for them because, like in Norway, the candidates for the election are nominated by the party members. There is no such system in Sri Lanka.

Asbestos is also banned in two States of Brazil, Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul. The most efficient way to eliminate asbestos-related diseases is to stop the use of all types of asbestos. Government establishments in Sri Lanka stopped using asbestos, including chrysotile, from last year. One of the principal suppliers of chrysotile asbestos to Sri Lanka is Russia. December's Khapra Beetle fiasco (when an invasive species of beetle was found in a consignment of tea exports from Sri Lanka to Russia) led to Russia imposing 'restrictions' on agriculture imports from Sri Lanka. Russia is the biggest importer of Sri Lankan tea according to latest Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) data, which covers Sri Lanka's trade statistics for the totality of 2016. These declines may have been due to Sri Lanka's proposed ban of asbestos imports. The release further said that Sri Lanka had been among the leading buyers of asbestos in the world. In 2015, the four leading asbestos importers in the world were India, Indonesia, China and Sri Lanka (buying from all asbestos exporting countries).

Now, their concern is that they need to put a ceiling on it. The price of that familiar benchmark barrel of Brent crude oil, from the waters off Aberdeen, has been rising in recent days, reaching USD 69.30 on Wednesday. Today's UK manufacturing figures from the Office for National Statistics reflect that exports are going especially well. While the link from economic growth to growth in demand for energy is not as clear as it was, it is still there. Such talk excites those who want Holyrood to take control of oil revenue, and either to spend it in an independent Scotland or to put it into an investment fund, as Norway has done, and very successfully so. What is sometimes missed is that Norway's benefits have accrued from both tax and from dividends on owning a large stake in its offshore industry. None of the UK's offshore reserves or production are publicly owned. No dividends come to the Treasury. What is also often forgotten in the excitement is that a large part of the Scottish economy is a consumer of energy, and while higher oil prices can boost tax revenues, they can suppress profits elsewhere, and economic growth. Nevertheless, the best estimates are of the value of oil and gas revenue being 83 per cent to more than 90 per cent from Scottish waters",NA,NA,English,0,0,0

Agriculture, forestry and other land uses together account for nearly a quarter of the greenhouse gas emissions heating up the planet, according to the FAO. In the early years, the climate negotiations focused on reducing emissions from the energy sector – the largest emitter – while the relationship between agriculture and climate change was not fully understood. Scientists have warned that world temperatures are likely to rise by 2 to 4.9 degrees Celsius this century compared with pre-industrial times. This could lead to dangerous weather patterns – including more frequent and powerful droughts, floods and storms – upping the pressure on agriculture. Curbing climate change will require overhauling the world’s food production and distribution system, which is “off the rails”, said Olav Kjørven, chief strategy officer at the Oslo-based EAT Foundation.

A new report by the National Endowment for Democracy argues that we need to re-think soft power because ‘the conceptual vocabulary that has been used since the Cold War’s end no longer seems adequate to the contemporary situation’. China’s economic success has generated both hard and soft power, but within limits. A Chinese economic aid package under the Belt and Road Initiative may appear benign and attractive, but not if the terms turn sour, as was recently the case in a Sri Lankan port project. Other exercises of economic hard power undercut the soft power of China’s narrative. China punished Norway for awarding a Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiabo. It also threatened to restrict access to the Chinese market for an Australian publisher of a book critical of China.

Sri Lanka, last month, accepted the much touted Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention or Ottawa Convention aka anti-personnel Mine Ban Treaty (MBT). Western powers, and some NGOs, acted irresponsibly though they publicly asserted terrorism would not be tolerated especially in the wake of 9/11. Strangely, a known LTTE front organisation - so-called Humanitarian De-Mining Unit (HDU), tasked with mine clearing operations in areas under LTTE control - received significant financial assistance from Norwegian People’s Aid, British Mine Advisory Group, Swiss Foundation for Mine Action and Danish De-Mining Group in the wake of the Norway-arranged Cease Fire Agreement (CFA). Interestingly, none of those who had been pushing Sri Lanka to accede to the MBT, ever uttered a word when mines were introduced at the onset of the conflict, in the 1980s.

It argues that 2018 would be a decisive year for Sri Lanka as the local government elections are fast becoming a general referendum as they will decide if the West-driven agenda carried out by the government will be approved by the people. It argues that the Joint Opposition is the only legitimate force that can derail the government’s programme, but questions how focused they are.

The article does not support power devolution and believes that the Central Government should have vested powers.  It further argues that this government is not interested in fulfilling their election promises. However, the pledges to the West-led international community, the extremist Tamil Diaspora, and India have been on track from the start. The article quotes Wimal Weerawansa who, citing Catalonia, explained that in that region, powers (including police powers) have been devolved. However, he pointed out if the same was to happen in the North and the East, the West would react differently. The first to recognise the North and East as a separate, independent state would be Norway, quickly followed by Canada.

They would acknowledge that for a considerable length of time these two provinces looked after their own affairs. Using these two arguments, they will reason their acceptance.

In the wake of the UK disclosure, Sri Lanka should have immediately called for a thorough reappraisal of the controversial process, leading up to Geneva Resolution 30/1, co-sponsored by Sri Lanka. Instead, the Sirisena-Wickremasinghe government made a pathetic effort to distance itself from the Naseby declarations that 40,000 civilians did not perish on the Vanni front and the allegation that the then government purposely targeted civilians.  Lord Naseby’s assertions were largely based on wartime UK Defence Attache, based in Colombo, Colonel Anton Gash. Against the backdrop of Lord Naseby disputing the March 2011 UN assertion that 40,000 civilians had been killed, a thorough inquiry is required on the procedure adopted by UNSG Panel of Experts’ (PoE) to gather so called war crimes evidence. Having accused Sri Lanka of indiscriminately killing, the PoE struggled to gather evidence.

In the absence of new solutions based on such analyses, the conflict seems to be hopelessly drifting without any prospects of a just and lasting resolution. The purpose here is to look at how Israel has cunningly used a set of myths to take possession of Jerusalem and the broader Israel, and to ‘join the dots’ that link the Israeli, American and British agendas for Jerusalem by focusing on the fertile admixture of biblical and other myths that bind them. The UN General Assembly unanimously declared Israeli measures invalid, insisting that the status of Jerusalem should be decided through negotiations. Again defying the UN, Israel effectively annexed Jerusalem in 1980. As recently as 30 November 2017, the UN General Assembly reiterated that any actions by Israel to impose its laws on Jerusalem were illegal and therefore null and void. No country has ever recognised Israeli sovereignty in East Jerusalem and no country, including the US, has its embassy in Jerusalem, until Trump’s announcement. Like all social and cultural groups including the ethnic communities in Sri Lanka Jews believe in mythologies that are supposed to embody the development of their particular group history and racial identity. Myths about the development of religion form an intrinsic part of all cultures, serving as a coping mechanism with passage through life from birth to death. Jewish claims that Jerusalem was the capital of the People of Israel 3,000 years ago are based on another myth-based account of a raid and conquest by King David. Palestinians counter claim that they are the descendants of Jebusites, then known as Jebus, who first settled and constructed Jerusalem before Joshua seized it. To complicate matters, Palestinians also claim partial descent from the Israelites and Maccabees, as well as all the other peoples who have lived in the region. The current hiatus in Palestinian-Israeli negotiation is due to the Palestinian rejection of a package put together through the so-called Oslo Process involving limited Palestinian self-government over disconnected patches of the occupied West Bank, with no right of return for refugees displaced by the wars of 1948 and 1967.",NA,NA,English,0,0,0

In coming years, we are likely to see a lot more jostling between India, China and others in the Indian Ocean over control of ports, airports and other pieces of critical infrastructure – and perhaps increasingly for control over governments. Our political processes, and the Govt’s direction and decisions, all have to be understood as arising from the Government’s plan of what Dr Indrajith Coomaraswamy called "" strategic promiscuity"". The plan of strategic integration into the global and regional big power competition i.e. conscious semi-colonization. It is as if a leader of this island centuries ago, instead of fighting against thePortuguese, the Dutch and the British, gave them all a piece of the island each and let them fight it out on our soil. What all this means is that there is a chance that the over-ambitious, ideologically driven neoliberal ‘reform agenda’ of the Yahapalana government will be replaced or displaced to the margins, by the conventional, normal logic of electoral performance and survival. If the reform agenda is neoliberal and globalist, electoral logic in this country is almost always populist, which also means nationalist. The reforms should have been primarily democratic and national, not primarily liberal and cosmopolitan/globalist, but they were. CBK’s disastrous Constitutional package, the openly federalist and ""security sector reform"" agenda of the Berghof Foundation (headed by Norbert Ropers), the anti-military recruitment Sudu Nelum (White Lotus) movement, the Norwegian ‘peace’ actually appeasement effort, Ranil Wickremesinghe’s CFA, and Chandrika’s PTOMS, were the utter, and utterly predictable (and predicted) failures that littered the decade 1995-2005, until Mahinda Rajapaksa was elected and cleared up the accumulated colossal mess, along with Prabhakaran and his Great Heroes.",NA,NA,English,-1,0,-1

Sooka made her claim in her capacity as the executive director of the Foundation for Human Rights in South Africa, and the International Truth and Justice Project. Sooka’s claim, as regards having the largest collection of witness testimony and other evidence outside Sri Lanka, should be closely examined against the backdrop of UNSG Panel of Experts declaration that it had received 4,000 submissions from 2,300 persons. The release of the report ‘Forgotten Sri Lanka’s exiled victims’ coincided with the commencement of the 32 sessions of the Geneva-based United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC).

Weather forecasting agencies around the world are constantly developing new systems to produce ever more accurate forecasts, capable of capturing fast-moving, often chaotic and localised weather events. But this means bigger models and even bigger computing capacity. The new setup offers several advantages over traditional forecasting systems. One is that more frequent updates should make their short-term forecasts more accurate. Other countries are watching to see how much of an improvement the new setup offers. Inger-LiseFrogner from the Department of Research and Development at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute describes this type of approach as “state of the art and in line with what other institutes are running and developing.” For now, weather forecasters aren’t routinely using a cell phone or vehicle data but that’s coming and over the next few years, research will result in methods and techniques to take advantage of those data sources",NA,NA,English,0,0,0

2017-11-28T00:00:00Z,The Island,Feature,Neutral,Neutral,Too much at stake for government to split,Jehan Perera,"This article states that Sri Lanka co-signed a resolution on post-war reconciliation to which it had contributed and which was approved unanimously by the Council. The Joint Opposition has called for the withdrawal of Sri Lanka from the commitments it made to the UN Human Rights Council and it came at a time when Sri Lanka has demonstrated its positive relationship with the international community on two occasions this month before the United Nations. The first was the Universal Periodic Review of the UN system in Geneva, where the government’s report on its adherence to human rights norms was scrutinized in detail by over one hundred countries out of which 88 countries also made their specific observations. The government delegation was led by Dr Harsha de Silva, deputy minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs. The second occasion on which the government addressed the international community was at the special session of the UN Peace building Commission in New York where a select group of countries which are elected to this Commission were present. It was evident at both these sessions that Sri Lanka had completely changed its image of being amongst the most troubled nations of the world and had established itself as a success story of post-war development. The reason for Sri Lanka’s success with the international community has been three fold. First is that the government has accepted the broad contours of internationally accepted best practices including the UN framework for peacebuilding and transitional justice. The second is that the present government sends to international forums those who will not follow a confrontational approach, and engage in wars of words, and instead skillfully practice their diplomatic arts. The third reason is also significant. It is that Sri Lanka presently has a government of national unity comprising the two main political parties and which has the backing of the main ethnic minority parties. It is notable that at the meeting of the UN Peacebuilding Commission, not only did the Western countries indicate their support for Sri Lanka’s reconciliation process. In addition the representatives of China, Colombia, Egypt, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Kenya in addition to those from the EU, Japan, Norway, Belgium and the USA made interventions to express support for Sri Lanka and appreciation for sharing its experiences with the Peacebuilding Commission, which would prove useful for other countries to learn from as well. The Joint Opposition’s threat to the UN mandated human rights and peacebuilding process has become more immediate due to the forthcoming local government elections. The dilemma for the SLFP component of the government that is headed by President Sirisena is that if the SLFP goes into these elections divided between themselves and the SLFP component in the Joint Opposition that is headed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, they are both unlikely to fare well as the SLFP vote will be divided.",NA,NA,English,0,0,0

In addition, the Crown Price's Vision 2030 plan, among its many elements to modernize and diversify the kingdom, calls for a new city, Neom, that has an estimated cost of $500 billion. Against that backdrop, the Crown Prince recklessly arrested dozens of Saudi tycoons on charges of corruption. But playing this corruption card has also rattled the nerves of investors. International investors have been shaken. After all, many of those tycoons who were arrested were not just prominent in the rolodexes of the world's biggest investment banks and fund managers. However, this valuation may now be in doubt, thanks to market worries about the Crown Prince's grip on power and thanks to the Norwegians. Norges Bank, managing Norway's sovereign wealth fund the world's largest with assets of around $1 trillion looks at world oil prices. Its analysts see the prospect of lower oil price levels for some years to come (due in part to increasing US oil and gas production, plus the rise of solar, wind and other energy alternatives). As a result, Norway's fund has announced that it will be selling all its shares in giant oil companies, such as Exxon-Mobil, Shell and BP, currently valued at around $35 billion. Singapore's sovereign wealth fund might be interested, but it is a shrewd investor and may share the same views on the oil outlook as the Norwegians",NA,NA,English,0,0,0

Austin said, together with their sister organisation in Sri Lanka, SLASSCOM, they have now started a partnership which they believe may be a pilot for future business cooperation between Norway and other countries. As a good match is seen to be between the two countries in the ICT sector, Norwegian Ambassador Thorbjorn Gaustadsaether said that he hopes to see more businesses happening between the two countries. He stressed, it is important to look at some of these big areas with impact and to collectively come together to disrupt some of the value chains by combining forces of both the countries. Meanwhile, talking about how Sri Lanka is shaping up to be relevant to a digital economy, ICTA Senior Consultant Indika De Soyza said while digitizing the financial sector they are in the process of digitizing the education system where they have already taken up several initiatives.",NA,NA,English,1,1,2

EU 'citizens' could accept job offers and move freely to occupy themselves within any of the 28 member countries and EFTA-EEA States like Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. A hard Brexit means the UK would leave both EU Single Market and the Customs Union. Consequently, there would be no FMP between the UK and the EU. One of the main benefits of a hard Brexit would be, the UK could easily and freely engage in free trade contracts with any country in the world. A significant benefit of this is the possibility to continue FMP. For instance, though Norway has joined the EEA, they are not part of the Customs Union. Norway is member of the EFTA which was founded in 1960 to allow European countries which are not EU members, to enjoy benefits of free trade among them. An issue in the Norway Model is though it does not confer voting rights in theEU decision making process, it is bound to follow EU policies governing the EEA. If the Norway Model could be followed by the UK, then the right of FMP would be protected, and the UK could remain part of the Schengen area. In addition, the UK would be able to follow any trade policies with non-EU countries because it would not be bounded by the EU Customs Union. However, the UK would be bound by EU laws in certain areas except in defence, agriculture and fisheries, although they leave the EU, and UK would have to continue paying contributions to the EU.",NA,NA,English,0,0,0

After a brief foreword by Kailash Satyarthi, Vani tells us that she scripted the sagas of 16 women, who in their meeting with humanity found self-fulfilment through their unbound love and relentless struggle for peace and justice. Going from more recent times to that of the past, she begins her book with the case of Malala Yousafzai, who became internationally famous at the tender age of 14 as a child campaigner for girls’ education in the Swat Valley of Pakistan. Norway was mentioned as the article spoke about how the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that Aung San Suu Kyi would be conferred that year’s Nobel Peace Prize “for her non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights in Myanmar”.

The Government has elaborated on the strategy to be followed in delivering this promise to the people. That is to give a free hand to the Central Bank to push the inflation rate to a low level through a strategy known as ‘Inflation Targeting’ or in short, IT. The Economic Policy Statement has pronounced a two-pronged strategy to keep the prices down. One is to manage the supply of foods to the market in abundant quantities by improving the domestic supply chains and, whenever there is a shortage due to poor local production, fill the gap by importing foods while cutting import duties on same. The other is to allow the Central Bank to pursue a policy of inflation targeting. Thus, the two-pronged approach of fighting inflation is for the Government to manage the cost of living in the short run, while allowing the Central Bank to check inflation in the long run. But the problem arises not when the bank has eased monetary policy but when it has tightened it. Its tight monetary policy will restrict the aggregate demand of companies and people. To resolve this issue, it has been suggested that central banks should follow an inflation targeting policy. It differs from the current monetary policy strategy of the Central Bank. In the current policy, the Central Bank seeks to control inflation by controlling money, credit and interest rates. There are at least 28 countries today that have adopted inflation targeting as their monetary policy, according to IMF. The leading inflation targetters from the developed world are Australia, New Zealand, Canada, United Kingdom, South Korea, Norway, Sweden and Israel. Of the 28 countries which had adopted inflation targeting, not many have been able to stick to their promise. Countries like Sweden, Australia, New Zealand and Canada have been able to maintain inflation at the target levels.

Most of the highly developed countries such as Norway, Switzerland, Netherlands and Belgium have food self-sufficiency ratios of about 50% but this is no concern because of the very high per capita incomes.",NA,NA,English,0,0,0

2017-11-01T00:00:00Z,The Island,Long Opinion,Negative,Neutral,Lanka lacked strategy to counter lies propagated by Western powers,Shamindra Ferdinando,"This article mainly revolves around the failure on the part of the current government as well as the Joint Opposition to use Lord Naseby’s statement to defend the country couldn’t be justified under any circumstances. Prof. Wijesinha asserted that with the very basis of the Resolution 30/1 being challenged in the House of Lords, it would be the responsibility of the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe administration to request Geneva to revisit the case. SLFP factions certainly owed the country an explanation as to severe shortcomings in Sri Lanka’s defence. The writer believes what Lord Naseby really meant was that those who demanded accountability, on Sri Lanka’s part, on the basis of unsubstantiated accusations, to review their case. Unfortunately, those in power, as well as in the Joint Opposition, seemed to be uninterested in adopting a common strategy to clear Sri Lanka’s name. Norway was mentioned when the article spoke about how the Norway-led mission, comprising five countries, declared that nearly 4,000 people had been killed since the change of government, in Nov 2005, whereas 130 persons perished during the remaining period, covered by the CFA. The Scandinavian Truce Monitoring Mission aka Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) issued a controversial statement to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the Ceasefire Agreement (CFA); The SLMM consisted of international monitors, from five Nordic countries, namely Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, supported by local staff. The government never sought a clarification from the monitoring mission, or the Norwegian peace facilitators. The government’s failure would have even surprised the truce monitors as well as the co-chairs to the Sri Lankan peace process, namely the US, EU, Norway and Japan",NA,NA,English,-1,0,-1
